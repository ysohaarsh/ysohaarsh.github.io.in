        <div id="article-content">
          Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 â€“ July 20, 2017) was an
          American singer, songwriter, and occasional actor. He was best known
          as the lead vocalist for Linkin Park and was also lead vocalist for
          the bands Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise and, between 2013 and 2015, Stone
          Temple Pilots. Bennington has been credited by several publications as
          one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation.<hr>

          Benningtonfirst gained prominence as a vocalist following the release
           of Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide
          commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording
          Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling
          debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to
          achieve that many sales. Linkin Park's following studio albums,
          from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's
          success.<hr>

           Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side
          project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on
          October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in
          2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013,
          via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely
          on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as Crank
          (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).<hr>

          Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most 
          of his life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found 
          dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his death was ruled a
          suicide by hanging. Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number
          46 on their list of the "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time".
          Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned
          nu-metal universal".
